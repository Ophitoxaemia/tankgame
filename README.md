This is an intentionally retro game 2 player game, both in graphics and in coding style using Python and pygame. 

The coding style is retro in being simple so that a beginning programmer can understand it. No fancy syntax or tricks. No bewildering forest of curly brackets, arrows, hash signs, etc. Light on functions and heavy on duplicated code/hardcoded values. Like back when programming was most fun.

It was inspired by an ad in a computer magazine I saw in about 1977 which at the time owning a computer was a pipe dream. I also implemented a similar version on the original iPad written in Lua.

## Terrain Features

Brown Swamps - slows the tank's movement  
Green Forests - hides the tank  
Dark Walls - blocks movement and shells  
Mines - blows up the tank  

## Controls

Lots of controls, intentionally. 

Rotate tank right  
Rotate tank left  
Rotate turret left  
Rotate turrent right

## Multiple keyboards

It's a little more comfortable to play using 2 keyboards. There's a duplicate set of controls for this.
